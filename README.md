## Getting Started

First, run `docker compose up` in a separate terminal to get the Jaeger service started.

If this is your first time, run `npm run dev:full`. This will run `npm install && npx prisma migrate dev && npm run dev`.
Subsequently, you can just run `npm run dev`. This will run the basic `main` function.
